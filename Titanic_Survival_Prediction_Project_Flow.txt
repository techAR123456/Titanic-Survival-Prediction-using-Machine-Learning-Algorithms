Titanic Survival Prediction with XAI â€“ Project Flow

This project is a web-based application that predicts Titanic passenger survival and provides clear explanations for each prediction. It follows a structured workflow combining data processing, prediction, explanation, and visualization.

Workflow

1. Data Preparation
   - Titanic dataset is cleaned, transformed, and feature-engineered to create processed training and testing files.

2. Model Training
   - A machine learning model is trained on the processed data and saved for reuse.

3. Prediction & Explanation
   - For a given passenger, the system predicts survival chances.
   - Explainable AI (XAI) techniques generate human-readable explanations for why the passenger was predicted to survive or not.

4. Web Application Flow
   - User enters Passenger ID.
   - The system retrieves passenger details from the dataset.
   - The trained model makes a prediction and provides explanation.
   - Results are displayed on the web page.

5. User Interface
   - Displays passenger details, prediction results, and explanations.
   - Includes dynamic visuals and animations for an engaging experience.
   - Ensures accessibility by making results scrollable if long.
